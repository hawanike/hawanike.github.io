         To me, challenges are more than welcomed. Even as I'm writing this, my schedule is fully filled with radical target of what to achieve each day and it could all go wrong if even 
         a single target is not met (both academically and actual work). But that only makes me more determined to conquer. Even if the deadline of completing this webpage creating assignment 
         is extremely tight and the task is by mo mean simple, I'm even more thrilled to complete it not only in time but given margin for people to learn from my work and develop their own, 
         which further shortens my personal deadline. Or back in high school, my graduation project was what normally requires a team of university students and supervisors to complete, I was 
         unthusiastic to tackle the challenge and despite not achieving as much as I desired, I learned so much more than if I had done an easy work and proved my level of excellent commitment.
