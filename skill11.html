        <h3>Empathy</h3>
        <p>
        Despite highly concentrate on my goals, I always seek to return the gift in me to my society and this world. Starting from always willing to help cleaning up any party to willing 
        to sacrifice my own exam preparation to make tutorial documents giving my classmates better understanding of the subject, all the way to setting goals of my life solely based on 
        the benefit of all consciousness on earth not just human. As per the description "Essentially, it is putting yourself in someone else's position and feeling what they are feeling",
        I may not party but I do show up when they need help cleaning. I may not hanging out when there are still piles of dishes to be washed and people are all exhausted. I may not just 
        live a materially fulfilled life when lives on earth are stilling suffering from the mistake human made. I truly just can't pretend that life is good and enjoyable knowing there are 
        countless out there still suffereing from no fault of their own. Love is, to me, the strongest driving force and my love to all lives on earth is what keeps me going regardless of 
        what the obstacles may be.
