        <h3>Arts</h3>
        <p>
        As aforementioned, I came from a school system that lacks in theoretical knowledge. The gain from that however, is an extensive exposure to arts in different forms. I found 
        myself to be one withmusic, meaning that I develop much faster than anyone else and ended up at the first stand wherever I go despite rarely practicing. It might be considered 
        a gift but that's also thanks to how my parents had me listening to classical music way before I was born. I was invited by my teacher to join a concert event in Japan several 
        years after starting to play cello at age of 11. I attended music camps which filled with music student where I ended up being the only non-profesional player in the first row alongside highly talented graduated students and 
        professors and I was directly recruited by those professors there. Furthermore, I was chosen by my school to represent them at the 100 Year of Waldorf Education back in 2019 in 
        Germany. Despite the massive potential that awaits the realization, I chose to keep music as a life counter-balancer to my academic hardwork instead of becoing a professional 
        musician.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides music performance, I have an ability to understand and manipulate music which give me the ability to compose a song all from my sense. And besides music, I did a lot of 
            painting and drawing back in school which I love them all. Moreover, I was taught about Eurythmy which is an art of movement essential to Waldorf education. 
            Accompanied by live instrumental music or by the human voice in spoken poetry and tales, eurythmy has been called “visible song” and “visible speech”. I only came to realize its benefit 
            when having a hard time adapting to life in Germany back in 2021. I'm also proficient in photography all thanks to my friends back in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I'm currently designing a house for my family to live at a newly bought piece of land in Thailand as well. Arts are 
            essential to maintaining my sanity while working and studying hard everyday and to keep my perception from fully dwelling in academic world.
