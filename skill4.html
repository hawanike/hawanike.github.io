        <h3>Visionary</h3>
        <p>
            Enough said about my so-called "dreams" and "goals", here is what they are. After realizing that I really have potential to do many things, I settled on what this world could benefit 
            from the most, one of which is to solve human-caused global warming. I settled back in 2017 with these three main solutions.
            For on-land problems, my aim was to genetically modify plants such that it was made to absorb as much greenhouse 
            gases and air pollutants possible. For in-the-ocean problems, it was to genetically modify some bacteria so that it could produce plastic decomposing enzyme which should reduce the 
            amount of plastic waste in the ocean. For in-the-air problems, to let heat escape earth's atmosphere, I plan to integrate those photoyntheticble biosymbiont cyanobacteria into a 
            shelter organism, protecting it from severe temperature and radiation, and deploy those compounded lives from an automated air lab (probably self-automated lab attached to a balloon).
            Ideally, before falling down and burned in the atmosphere, it should be able to transform and reduce those excess CO2 in the atmosphere. But this is just to eradicate our specie's mistake 
            since the industrial revolution, to sustainably solve this problem, it requires a global collective effort to make a permanent change, not just some silver bullets solutions like these.

            To become such a person that's capable of achiving this, I planned my life accordingly. My work-life plan could be seen in the "About" section of my website.
