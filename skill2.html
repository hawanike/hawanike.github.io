        <h3>Naturally Innovative</h3>
        <p>
            Since young age, I always have a deep connection to innovating better solutions whether be it the way I learn and live to how I might potentially be able to solve 
            global warming. I wasn't satisfied with learning by memorizing words, numbers, and formulas. I'm not satisfied with having all the knowledge served to me. I instead 
            believe that to explore it by myself is the way, to tackle as much problem is the way, to boil down everything to the most simple logical structure is the way. That 
            is my way of engraving problem solving skills onto my brain, that is my way of strengthening my enalytical skills that will be crucial for my future works, knowledge 
            is only the useful byproduct of that process. I hope to translate this approach to finding solutions for global warming and settled with three of them back in 2017.
