        <h3>Fast Learner</h3>
        <p>
         I might not come equipped with every knowledge, but one thing I do have is the ability to learn well and fast. Even by learning to make this website, all it takes were hours 
         of learning on the internet to obtain knowledge, several experiments to understande the knowledge at its core, and several more hours to make it my own version from scratch. 
         This applies to every academic and non-academic subject I ever came across. This is hugely thanks to my school back in Thailand (Panyotai Waldorf School). Their core value of 
         education is not to feed students' brain with as much information as possible but to encourage them to find who they want to become in this world and to know how to learn, the 
         rest they could fiil up themselves. Hence my theoretical knowledge deficit at the start of my university years, I'm able to learn any needed subject at a blisteringly fast rate. 
        One prime example being when I was doing the robot for graduation, the combination of relentlessness, sheer will, and this fast learning ability, I learned to design a robot component 
         during my internship (further detail in "Work Experience section"), learned to master 3D printing, learned to code its necessary software, tackled and overcame countless of problems 
         all by myself.

        </p>
        <p>
            In the future at the forefront of science and technology where the abundance of pre-existing information no longer presented, the ability to learn fast from limited set of information 
         is key to unlocking better innovations, hence I treasure this trait and focus on further development.
