                <hr>
                <h4>Future</h4>
                <p>I plan to continue studying </p>
                <p>-Biochemistry and Cell Biology at Constructor University for my Bachelor degree</p>
                <p>-Bio Nanotechnology and Synthetic Biology at Technical University of Munich for my Master degree</p>
                <p>-it's still undecide where and what exactly will my doctorate degree be but I'm doing it for sure</p>
                <p>-I plan to work in top companies for several years to obtain the knowledge of how they operate that sheer scale of business before starting my own startup</p>
                <p>and to be able to sustain the business</p>
                <p>-my investment by then should be able to partly fund my startup apart from supporting my family</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Lifestyle</h4>
                <p>My lifestyle firstly prioritizes maximum efficiency and therefore focuses on keeping the body, brain, and mind within the optimum operating window.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I prioritize only doing what's essential to my future, hence the aggressive elimination of activities such as entertainment and excesshuman interaction.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, I balance myself between developing my brain with academic study, rejuvenating my sould with arts and music, strengthening my body with sports.</p>
                <p>Only scale up the work rate when the balanced efficiency is achieved. In this way,only useful things will be done, and they will be done properly</p>
                <p>In order to maintain simultaneous flow of progresses in my life, I organize my lifestyle as in the <a href="poster.html">diagram here.</a></p>
