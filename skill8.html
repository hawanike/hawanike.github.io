        <h3>Investment</h3>
        <p>
        I might have dreams to persue, but I also have a family to take care of. The reason I could develop and become who I am is my family, both my parents have always been working hard 
        coming from a poor background. They have gone so far from where they started and deserved nothing but the best life. I want the rest of hardworking part to be mine as soon as possible 
        so that they could take a rest they deserve and live a worriless life as a reward. One main part of their work was to financially support the family, so that's where I plan to takeover. 
        Thanks to their guidance since young age, I started investing in stocks and funds as soon as I'm legally eligible. My approach to investment is no different from my approach to life. I 
        invest in companies that have the quality to succeed for years to come. It takes countless hours of hardwork to be able to analyze such business and to learn to properly evaluate their 
        stock value that will lead to my purchasing decision. At this rate, I should be able to financially support myself from my doctorate degree onwards and will take several more years until 
        my parents could live off of my investment's devidend. Furthermore, as I have a plan to start my own business, it is not as easy for startups to rely on external fundings like it was in 
        the last decade, my well planned invesment should provide me enough money to fund or leverage for my business. As a byproduct, I learned to identify and analize great companies and could 
        use this knowledge as a framework to start a succesful business even from organization cultural level.
