        <h3>Sport</h3>
        <p>
        As a child, I wasn't a very healthy person. I was allergic to many things and the way my parents chose to tackle this problem was to strengthen me through sports. I started from football and 
        swimming at age 5, tennis and equestrian at age 8, badminton at age 10, basketball at age 13, archery at age 14 and a little bit of volleyball at 17. I enjoy playing all of them at anytime 
        and since arriving at Constructor University in September 2022, I started playing volleyball for real and got into university's team with barely any experience at all. 
        </p>
        <p>
        More importantly, sports taught me to work as a team, to value effort and to be respectful to others. These side benefits are also instrumental to running my startup and establishing a 
        proper working culture within the organization. This perfectly balanced my highly individualistic character and leadership.
