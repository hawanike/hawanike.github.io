        With all the aforementioned skills, it is no surprise that I excel at any subject I ever learned. For language, I passed Telc C1 Hochschule for German and Duolingo C1 for English. 
        My other invaluable ability is intuition, the ability to make the most sensible 
        solution possible. Back when I was designing my graduation robots, the initial design of having the mechanism mimic real human body's, having arms' motor units mostly in shoulder 
        and inner torso or even the joint mechanism was done all from my intuition. I only found out years later that the best humanoid robot at the time, the AMBIDEX from Naver Lab, was 
        using the exact same design philosophy. Or, the idea of having bacteria producing plastic decomposing enzyme back in 2017 that became a reality years after. Or getting bored from 
        class back in 2018, I wanted to make an air freshener by containing microalgae in a PTFE/ePTFE bag or bax that lets air through and cultivatee the algae by optimum wavelength, intensity and 
        duration of light only for all of that to be done by a university in Serbia later in 2022. I hope to carry on this approach to make this world a better place for all lives, that's 
        all I really want at all.
